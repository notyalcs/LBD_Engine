# LBD_Engine
LBD game engine for COMP 4995

## Run the sample game:
- Change the ip in LBDEngine/Headers/Utilities/Constants.h to your ip and build and run Server/server.cpp (either Visual Studio or command line compile).
### Or
- you can comment out lines 25, 28, 29, 86, 87 from LBDEngine/Source/Main/Game.cpp. Please note that you will not be able to move the camera at all because you won't be a "player".

## Controls:
- WASD to move
- Left click and hold to move camera
- Left Shift to stop aerial momentum

## NOTE:
- The game will end when one of the AIs make it to the end. You can play twice before having to restart the server.
